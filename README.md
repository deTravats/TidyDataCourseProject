# TidyDataCourseProject

## Aim
This repository has been created as part of my Data Science Course *to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set*. The goal is to tidy a data table from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that can be used for later analysis.

## Description of the repository
This repository contains :
1. A README.md file 
2. A CodeBook.md file, that explains the variables and their units
3. The run_analysis.R script, that shows you each step I used to tidy the data set provided
4. The Finished_Work.txt data table, that I obtained with the STEP 5 of my run_analysis.R script

## Conclusion
I hope you'll find your way in this repository and that some of it will make sense.

Enjoy !
